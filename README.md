## Description
This repository documents my learning path based on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh) during my university holidays. The objective is to master key technologies in system administration, DevOps and monitoring in a period of 31 days through hands-on projects and educational resources in Spanish and English.  

### Technologies to learn:

- Security and Networking:** Firewall, Proxy, Network Protocols (HTTP/S, SSL/TLS, DNS, etc.)  
- Monitoring and logs:** Grafana, Prometheus, Loki, Elastic Stack, DataDog  
- Operating systems:** Windows, Bash/Shell  
- **Load balancing and caching servers:** Load Balancer, Caching Server.  

### Work plan:  
1. Spend **1.5 hours per day** on projects and learning.  
2. Create hands-on projects to apply each technology or tool.  
3. Document learning and processes in this repository.  

This space will be a public record of my progress, with tutorials, guides and examples for others to reference.
